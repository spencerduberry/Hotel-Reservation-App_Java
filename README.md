## Overview 
This application allows users to make hotel reservations for customers. Users can choose room types, assign room numbers, input customer names, and specify the length of stay. The system also allows viewing reservation details, generating a total revenue report, sorting reservations alphabetically, and displaying room availability.
## Key Features:
- **Make reservations** for customers, including room type, room number, customer name, and length of stay.
- **Display reservation details** by searching by customer name.
- **Generate a report** of total revenue generated from all bookings.
- **Sort reservations** alphabetically by last name.
- **Display available rooms** for each room type.
## Technologies Used:
- **Java** (Version 5 or higher recommended)
- **Eclipse** (for initial development, but now using Visual Studio Code for continued work)
- **Java Collections Framework** (Map, TreeSet, etc.)
## Installation
### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** - You will need to have Java 5 or later installed. 
[Download Oracle JDK here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)

- **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)** - For continued development, you can use VSCode. It's lightweight and supports Java development.

- **Room**: Defines the properties of each room type (e.g., capacity, room number, rate) and includes methods for calculating revenue and checking room availability.
### Notes
- **Java Version**: This application is compatible with Java 5 or later. It's recommended to use Java 8 for optimal performance and features.
- **Future Updates**: This project was initially developed in Eclipse, but it will now be maintained and developed using Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
